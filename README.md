## Introduction
This Monty Python Interpreter is a whimsical and powerful tool for executing Pythonic commands in a stack-based environment. Inspired by the legendary Monty Python comedy troupe, our interpreter brings a touch of humor to your coding journey.

## Getting Started
To dive into the world of Monty Python, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrimotionStudio/monty.git
    ```

2. Compile the interpreter:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
    ```

3. Run your first Monty Python script:
    ```bash
    ./monty your_script.m
    ```

## Commands
Our interpreter supports a variety of Pythonic commands. Here are some examples:

- **PUSH:** Push a value onto the stack.
    ```python
    push 42
    ```

- **POP:** Remove the top element from the stack.
    ```python
    pop
    ```

- **SWAP:** Swap the top two elements on the stack.
    ```python
    swap
    ```

- **ADD:** Add the top two elements on the stack.
    ```python
    add
    ```

- **SUB:** Subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element.
    ```python
    sub
    ```

- **NOP:** No operation. It does nothing (seriously!).
    ```python
    nop
    ```

- **PALL:** Prints all the elements in the stack.
    ```python
    pall
    ```

- **PINT:** Prints the value at the top of the stack.
    ```python
    pint
    ```

- **MUL:** Multiplies the second top element of the stack by the top element.
    ```python
    mul
    ```

- **DIV:** Divides the second top element of the stack by the top element.
    ```python
    div
    ```

- **MOD:** Computes the remainder of dividing the second top element.
    ```python
    mod
    ```

- **PCHAR:** Prints the character at the top of the stack.
    ```python
    pchar
    ```

- **PSTR:** Prints the string starting at the top of the stack.
    ```python
    pstr
    ```

- **ROTL:** Rotates the stack to the top.
    ```python
    rotl
    ```

- **ROTR:** Rotates the stack to the bottom.
    ```python
    rotr
    ```

Feel free to explore and experiment with these commands! ü§ì
