## Introduction
This Monty Python Interpreter is a whimsical and powerful tool for executing Pythonic commands in a stack-based environment. Inspired by the legendary Monty Python comedy troupe, our interpreter brings a touch of humor to your coding journey.

## Getting Started
To dive into the world of Monty Python, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrimotionStudio/MontyPythonInterpreter.git
    ```

2. Compile the interpreter:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
    ```

3. Run your first Monty Python script:
    ```bash
    ./monty your_script.mpy
    ```

## Commands
Our interpreter supports a variety of Pythonic commands. Here are some examples:

- **PUSH:** Push a value onto the stack.
    ```python
    push 42
    ```

- **POP:** Remove the top element from the stack.
    ```python
    pop
    ```

- **SWAP:** Swap the top two elements on the stack.
    ```python
    swap
    ```

- **ADD:** Add the top two elements on the stack.
    ```python
    add
    ```

- **NOP:** No operation. It does nothing (seriously!).
    ```python
    nop
    ```

Feel free to explore and experiment with these commands! ü§ì
